Design a <strong>hardwire-control unit</strong> for the following architecture. Use the structure that you have designed in <strong>Project2</strong>.

INSTRUCTION FORMAT

There are two types of instructions as described below.

<strong>(1)</strong> Instructions with address reference has the format shown in Figure 1:

<ul>

 <li>The OPCODE is a 5-bit field (See Table 1 for the definition).</li>

 <li>The REGSEL is a 2-bit field (See left side of Table 2 for the definition).</li>

 <li>The ADDRESSING MODE is a 1-bit field (See Table 3 for the definition).</li>

 <li>The ADDRESS is 8 bits</li>

</ul>

<table width="602">

 <tbody>

  <tr>

   <td width="156">OPCODE</td>

   <td width="155">REGSEL</td>

   <td width="156">ADDRESSING MODE</td>

   <td width="135">ADDRESS</td>

  </tr>

 </tbody>

</table>

<h2>Figure 1: Instructions with an address reference</h2>

<strong>(2)</strong> Instructions without address reference has the format shown in Figure 2:

<ul>

 <li>The OPCODE is a 5-bit field (See Table 1 for the definition).</li>

 <li>DESTREG is a 3-bit field which specifies the destination register (See right side of Table 2 for the definition).</li>

 <li>SRCREG1 is a 3-bit field which specifies the first source register (See right side of Table 2 for the definition).</li>

 <li>SRCREG2 is a 3-bit field which specifies the second source register (See right side of Table 2 for the definition).</li>

</ul>

<table width="604">

 <tbody>

  <tr>

   <td width="157">OPCODE</td>

   <td width="156">DESTREG</td>

   <td width="156">SRCREG1</td>

   <td width="134">SRCREG2</td>

  </tr>

 </tbody>

</table>

<h1>EXAMPLE</h1>

The code given below adds data that are stored at M[A0]+M[A1]+M[A2]+M[A3]+M[A4] and stores the total at M[A5]. It is written as a loop that iterates 5 times.

You have to determine the binary code, write it into memory, and execute all these instructions.

ORG  0x20                                   # Write the program starting from the address 0x20

LD R0 IM 0x05                 #  R0 is used for iteration number

LD R1 IM 0x00                #  R1 is used to store total

LD R2 IM 0xA0

MOV AR R2                     # AR is used to track data adrress: starts from 0xA0

LABEL:   LD R2 D                            # R2 &lt;- M[AR] (AR = 0xA0 to 0xA4)

INC AR AR                      # AR &lt;- AR + 1 (Next Data)
